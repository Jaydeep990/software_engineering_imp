- Software engineering discusses systematic and cost-effective techniques
  for software development.
  These techniques help develop software using an engineering approach.

## 1.Explain software engineering as a layered technology. [03]
- Software engineering is a fully layered technology, to develop software we need to go from one layer to another.
- All the layers are connected and each layer demands the fulfillment of the previous layer.
- Layered technology is divided into four parts:
1. **A quality focus:** 
- It defines the continuous process improvement principles of software. 
- It provides integrity that means providing security to the software so that data can be accessed by only an authorized person, no outsider can access the data. It also focuses on maintainability and usability.
2. **Process:** 
- It is the foundation or base layer of software engineering.
- It is key that binds all the layers together which enables the development of software before the deadline or on time.
- Process defines a framework that must be established for the effective delivery of software engineering technology.
- The software process covers all the activities, actions, and tasks required to be carried out for software development. 
- **Process activities are listed below:-**
  - Communication: It is the first and foremost thing for the development of software. Communication is necessary to know the actual demand of the client.
  - Planning: It basically means drawing a map for reduced the complication of development.
  - Modeling: In this process, a model is created according to the client for better understanding.
  - Construction: It includes the coding and testing of the problem.
  - Deployment:- It includes the delivery of software to the client for evaluation and feedback.

3. **Method:** 
- During the process of software development the answers to all “how-to-do” questions are given by method. 
- It has the information of all the tasks which includes communication, requirement analysis, design modeling, program construction, testing, and support.
4. **Tools:** 
- Software engineering tools provide a self-operating system for processes and methods. 
- Tools are integrated which means information created by one tool can be used by another.

2.What is process model? Compare incremental process model with prototyping 
process model. [04]

3.Compare Spiral Model with Prototype mode. [04]

4.Compare Waterfall model with RAD model. [03]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5.Distinguish between a program and a software product. [03]
- A program is a set of instructions that are given to a computer in 
order to achieve a specific task whereas software is when a program is made
available for commercial business and is properly documented along with 
its licensing.
- Software=Program+documentation+licensing.
- A program is one of the stages involved in the development of the 
software, whereas a software development usually follows a life cycle, 
which involves the feasibility study of the project, requirement gathering,
development of a prototype, system design, coding, and testing.

6.Which are the major phases in the waterfall model of software 
development? Which phase consumes the maximum effort for developing 
a typical software product? [04]

7.With suitable illustration explain SPIRAL model evolutionary software
development. [07]
