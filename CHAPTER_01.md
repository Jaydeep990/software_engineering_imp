- Software engineering discusses systematic and cost-effective techniques
  for software development.
  These techniques help develop software using an engineering approach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1.Explain software engineering as a layered technology. [03]
- Software engineering is a fully layered technology, to develop software we need to go from one layer to another.
- All the layers are connected and each layer demands the fulfillment of the previous layer.
- Layered technology is divided into four parts:
1. **A quality focus:** 
- It defines the continuous process improvement principles of software. 
- It provides integrity that means providing security to the software so that data can be accessed by only an authorized person, no outsider can access the data. It also focuses on maintainability and usability.
2. **Process:** 
- It is the foundation or base layer of software engineering.
- It is key that binds all the layers together which enables the development of software before the deadline or on time.
- Process defines a framework that must be established for the effective delivery of software engineering technology.
- The software process covers all the activities, actions, and tasks required to be carried out for software development. 
- **Process activities are listed below:-**
  - Communication: It is the first and foremost thing for the development of software. Communication is necessary to know the actual demand of the client.
  - Planning: It basically means drawing a map for reduced the complication of development.
  - Modeling: In this process, a model is created according to the client for better understanding.
  - Construction: It includes the coding and testing of the problem.
  - Deployment:- It includes the delivery of software to the client for evaluation and feedback.

3. **Method:** 
- During the process of software development the answers to all “how-to-do” questions are given by method. 
- It has the information of all the tasks which includes communication, requirement analysis, design modeling, program construction, testing, and support.
4. **Tools:** 
- Software engineering tools provide a self-operating system for processes and methods. 
- Tools are integrated which means information created by one tool can be used by another.

|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.     | Waterfall model known as Classical/Traditional Model.                           | RAD stands for Rapid Application Development.                                                                       |
| 2.     | Planning is required in early stage.                                            | There is no such constraint in RAD model.                                                                           |

| 4.     | There is high amount risk in waterfall model.                                   | There is low amount risk in RAD model.                                                                              |
| 5.     | In waterfall model large team size is required.                                 | In RAD model small team size is required.                                                                           |
| 6.     | Waterfall model can’t handle large project.                                     | RAD model also can’t handle large project but usually it is preferred between large and small project.              |
| 7.     | Any changes can be made in waterfall model only at the beginning.               | Any changes can be made in RAD model anytime.                                                                       |
| 8.     | The product of Waterfall model is delivered after the completion of all stages. | The product of RAD model is delivered as soon as possible.                                                          |
| 9.     | There is long waiting time for running software in waterfall model.             | There is less waiting time for running software in RAD model, as its first version is released as soon as possible. |
| 10.    | Waterfall model is not compatible with the change in client requirements.       | RAD model may work with the change in client requirements.                                                          |
| 11.    | It is not flexible to changes.                                                  | It is flexible to changes.                                                                                          |
| 12.    | Customer control over the administrator is very less.                           | Customer control over the administrator is more in comparison to waterfall model.                                   |
